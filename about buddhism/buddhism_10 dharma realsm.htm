<p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> This is the general term for the &quot;things&quot;, 
  noumenal or phenomenal. In Buddhism, there are ten states of existence, which 
  are also called Ten Dharma Realms. Each Dharma realm has its own characteristics, 
  and its existence is attributed to the retribution of the beings. These ten 
  realms do not appear to be discrete in their forms, as their existence is virtually 
  determined by the state of mind. Therefore, it is important to note that the 
  ten Dharma realms are not beyond a single thought. <br>
  <br>
  The lowest six realms are known as the Six Paths or Six Realms of Rebirth. These 
  six states of existence are subjected to birth and death, and then rebirth for 
  many lives. One's state of existence depends on one's karmic activities. With 
  evil karmic power, one will be born in the lowest three realms, known as Three 
  Evil Path (of transmigration). With good and kind karma, one will be born in 
  the upper three realms, known as Three Good Paths (of transmigration). <br>
  The upper four realms are known as the Four Holy Realms. These four states of 
  existence are beyond birth and death and liberated from the Samara. <br>

  Suffering is most severe, continuous and everlasting. Those beings must have 
  committed unforgivable and evil deed, with no regret or repent. The evil karma 
  determines their existence in hell. They suffer until they are completely retributed 
  or the evil karma vanishes. However, for those who committed the Five Offences

<p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> The performance of good or bad deeds, 
  symbolise one's ascending to the heavens or descending to Hell under the law 
  of karma. It is not the judgement of any Buddhas or gods, nor is it the judgement 
  of any Supreme God; it is in respect to everyone's wishes and it manifests accordingly. 
  In the eyes of the good people there is no Hell, because they do not have karma 
  with it. In the eyes of the bad people, there is a manifestation of Hell, because 
  Hell is the manifestation of their minds. Simply, it is one's own conscience 
  punishing one's own sins. <br>
  The sufferings of Hell include unlimited coming alive and dying within a single 
  day. The hell that has the most suffering is the Avici Hell. The suffering of 
  Avici Hell is clearly described in the Ksitigarbha Sutra. The first suffering 
  is uninterrupted time, meaning there is no rest. The suffering is continuous, 
  there is no respire for even one minute or one second. The second suffering 
  is uninterrupted space. In Avici Hell, space is filled with one or many persons. 
  If there is a lot of space, a person will multiply himself until he occupies 
  all the space. So this hell can be full with only one person. The third is uninterrupted 
  suffering. One has to suffer all the kinds of suffering in the world. There 
  is no hell which has more suffering than this Avici Hell. Such suffering is 
  called unlimited suffering. The fourth suffering is uninterrupted grade, meaning 
  this hell does not differentiate, whether one is a god in heaven, a human in 
  the human realm, a hungry ghost within the ghost realm or an animal within the 
  animal realm. If one &quot;qualified&quot;, anyone can enter Avici Hell and 
  receive the same treatment. The fifth suffering is uninterrupted life. There 
  are numerous lives and deaths within a day and a night, and, between one life 
  and one death, one suffers. </font></p>

  <font size="5">2. Ghost<a name="2ghost"></a> </font><img src="Images/ghost.gif" width="154" height="49"><br>
  In this realm, most of the ghosts always live in the atmosphere of anxiety, 
  illusion and fear. Their desires are never satisfied. The hungry ghosts cannot 
  eat as their throat is as narrow as a pin, but their stomach is as large as 
  a drum. Apart from hungry ghosts, there are also Yaksa, Raksa, Spiritual Ghosts, 
  etc.. Spiritual ghosts are dwelling in the nature, e.g. trees, mountains and 
  seas, and protecting the creatures, while Yaksa and Raksa are evil, malignant 
  and violent. <br>
  <br>
  If one wants to avoid descending into the Realm of the Hungry Ghost, one has 
  to learn to control one's desires. One cannot have an insatiable desire. In 
  general, the desires of humans are for money, sex, fame, food and sleep. <br>
  <br>
  If one desires wealth, one should reason that life only lasts for several decades, 
  and that this body is illusive and will soon vanish once one dies. One should 
  be satisfied once one has enough money to spend. One should not enslave one's 
  body and mind to constantly pursue wealth causing a disturbance in one's body 
  and mind and making one a slave to acquisition. Such a person, when he or she 
  dies, will most likely fall into the Realm of the Hungry Ghost because of insatiable 
  desire. If we constantly contemplate this, erroneous thoughts in desiring wealth 
  will slowly disappear. <br>
  <br>
  An insatiable desire for sex is also one of the greatest desires of humans. 
  If one wants to avoid it, one should cultivate the meditation on impurity. Impurity 
  means the impurity of the physical body. Outwardly, the body is beautiful. Inside 
  are bones covered with offensive smelling meat. The sensual enjoyments of sight, 
  smell, sound and taste are only temporary. The beautiful body is fleeting, like 
  dew, a dream, a bubble or lightning. We must not become attached to such illusive 
  beauty, for such attachment is a major obstacle in our cultivation. Everything 
  should be viewed naturally - not because beauty has moved our hearts. In this 
  way, we will not be greedy towards the temporary enjoyments of sight, smell, 
  sound, taste, and touch. <br>
  <br>
  Concerning fame, few people in the world remain unattached to it, especially 
  in the face of the ancient saying, &quot;People strive to prove their worth, 
  and the Buddha strives to prove His honour.&quot; The problem concerning fame 
  is pronounced. Think about this: throughout history, how many people have pursued 
  fame and fought for it? And how many of them can really be remembered? The world 
  is changing all the time and sentient beings transmigrate and regenerate. <br>
  <br>
  Life on earth is even shorter; very soon it will be all over like bubbles and 
  the dream flower. Even the physical body does not last forever, much less fame 
  and honour. If one does not exist, where is one's foothold for fame? So, whether 
  it is slander or praise, we should follow our conscience to uphold our integrity 
  and avoid asking for fame. Then the greed for fame will subside and an honourable 
  name will be formed from generation to generation. <br>
  <br>
  Indulging in the desire for good food will become serious. It seems to be a 
  small matter, but the harm it will cause is great. We cannot have unrestricted 
  desire for good food because, if we have insatiable appetites and are constantly 
  changing our taste, it will be very easy to commit killing [of an animal]. Furthermore, 
  indulging in too much in food increases the cruel side of our nature and encourages 
  our animalistic sexual desires. This will become a major obstacle in our cultivation. 
  Therefore, it is better to treat food lightly and consume only pure food. <br>
  <br>
  Next, we must consider the fondness for sleep. We have to put a limit here, 
  too. If we are overly desirous of its comfort, it will encourage laziness and 
  increase drowsiness. The mind will veer off the righteous path toward evil. 
  Isn't this horrible? <br>
  Hungry ghosts are hungry all the time, if they find food and put it into their 
  mouths, it will change into flames, burning their mouths. They are starving, 
  yet they cannot eat. So &quot;hunger&quot; is the major suffering, and that 
  is why this realm is called the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. <br>
  <br>
  The Realm of Hungry Ghosts is a form of punishment for greed. This is one of 
  the three lower realms of existence (the other two are the Animal Realm and 
  Hell). </font></p>

  <font size="5">3. Animal<a name="3Animal"></a> </font><img src="Images/Animal.gif" width="154" height="49"><br>
  It is a special path. All the beings within the Six Realms which do not belong 
  to any other five realms are categorised in this path. Animals can exist in 
  all other five paths.<br>
  </font><font color="435f13"><br>
  Animals have minimal intelligence and consciousness. They live in adaption to 
  the nature. As their behaviour follows instinct without deliberation, their 
  karma is neutral, i.e. neither good nor evil. <br>
  <br>
  We frequently see the behaviour of animals. Many animals fight with each other 
  and many also consume each other. Animals also suffer from hunger and disease. 
  Furthermore, they suffer the hot, cold, windy and rainy fluctuations of the 
  weather. This kind of suffering is hard for humans-the supreme beings of all 
  creatures to imagine. The deaths of animals are full of misery. <br>
  <br>
  Mostly they are pursued and killed by their same species or a different species. 
  Mosquito, flies, lice and worms die of disintegration. Chickens, ducks, fish, 
  goats and pigs are killed and cooked. Almost everything that flies in the sky, 
  swims in the sea, or crawls on the earth, cannot escape becoming the food of 
  humans. Even earthworms have caught the attention of humans. It looks as if 
  even earthworms cannot escape ending up as a main dish on restaurant menu! <br>

  <font size="5">4. Asura<a name="4asura"></a> </font><img src="Images/Asura.gif" width="154" height="49"><br>
  It is a peculiar path in the Six paths. In terms of material enjoyment and psychic 
  power, it is similar to Deva. However, in some aspects, it is even worse than 
  Human Path. The male Asura is extremely ugly, while the female is as beautiful 
  as an angel. The male Asura always fights with each other as they are cruel 
  and furious. They are proud of themselves, and reluctant to learn and practise 
  the Buddhist teachings. <br>
  <br>
  Asuras is a collective term for Yaksas, Raksasas and other demons. This realm 
  is formless. Generally speaking, asuras have cultivated goodness and performed 
  good deeds. But they are very combative and they get angry very easily. They 
  love to compete and fight. Because they have not rid themselves of anger, they 
  are not qualified for entering heaven and, hence, they fall into the Realm of 
  Asuras. These ghosts and spirits, though they have benevolent thoughts, do not 
  have peaceful days because they are so competitive. <br>
  <br>
  So, in order to avoid falling into the Realm of Nature Spirits, one must retain 
  a heart that is compassionate, righteous, in compliance with propriety, honest 
  and benevolent. <br>

  It is the Dhama realm which we are most familiar with. In this realm, we have 
  both happiness and suffering. It is a material world, and the mind activities 
  are always connected with the principles of matter. Joy and happiness are limited 
  as freedom is also limited by the body and other sensual organs of a man. On 
  the other hand, suffering can be the main cause or condition to allow man to 
  possess a kind heart, thus to pursue the Buddhist Way. In this respect, Human 
  Path is better than Deva Path. <br>
  <br>
  Actually, even if one wants to be reborn as a human, it is not that simple. 
  At the minimum, one has to observe the Five Precepts in order to be reborn as 
  human. The Five Precepts are: <br>
  <br>
  1) Avoid killing. One has to have compassion for all kinds of animals and birds. 
  One should love them and protect them from being killed; <br>
  <br>
  2) Avoid stealing. One should not steal or take by force even something as small 
  as a blade of grass or a flower, without the consent of the owner. Love thyself 
  and be honest; <br>
  <br>
  3) Avoid illicit sex. Practice monogamy. All those who act against propriety 
  and abandon themselves to carnal pleasures are considered to indulge in illicit 
  sex,<br>
  </font><font color="435f13"><br>
  4). Avoid lying. If one distorts Truth or confuses justice with injustice, these 
  also constitute lying; <br>
  <br>
  5) Avoid intoxicants. It is acceptable to use wine as a medicine. Otherwise, 
  if one drinks and gets drunk, it becomes a major source of evil. Therefore, 
  it is better to stay away from intoxicants in order to avoid causing evil. <br>

  It is a heaven for those who are wise and kind as the retribution for their 
  good deed. Their major desires will be satisfied. In this path, it is divided 
  into Three Heavenly Realms, namely Desire Heaven Realm, Form (or Rupa) Heaven 
  Realm, Formless (or Arupa) Heaven Realm. In the Desire Heaven Realm, the living 
  beings have strong desire in material and can be easily and fully satisfied 
  with enjoyment. In the Form Heaven Realm, the living beings are not interested 
  in material. Instead, their bodies and mind pursue the spiritual happiness, 
  such as philosophy, music, art and meditation. In the Formless Heaven Realm, 
  the living beings do not attach to the material nor their own bodies. They are 
  free from any hindrances, and they live in a state of joy, freedom and psychic 
  power. It is the wisdom and the karma of the Deva to determine which heaven 
  realm they live in.<br>
  <br>
  If ordinary people want to ascend to the heavens, they have to practice the 
  Ten Wholesome Actions. Once they have perfected themselves in the Ten Wholesome 
  Actions, they are qualified to ascend to heaven. <br>

<p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> What good is there to being born in the 
  heavens? There are many reasons. The gods in the heavens are wearing the best 
  kinds of clothing, clean, fragrant, and dustless. The crowns they are wearing 
  emit infinite light, and are both colourful and magnificent- one can hardly 
  find such on earth. Moreover the bodies of the gods are subtle and light with 
  no impurities and no foul smell. Food and clothing come to them naturally, manifesting 
  whenever the gods desire them. In short, the gods can have whatever they desire; 
  the supply is inexhaustible. There is also an inexhaustible supply of good music 
  in the heavenly realm. All gods emit light from their bodies, and their bathing 
  water dries on its own. <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, the five desires [arising from the objects of the five senses - things 
  seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or touched are satisfied naturally. Moreover, 
  the eyes of the gods are clear and far reaching. Their spirit is always bright 
  and luminous. <br>
  The most important question is, what are the heavens? According to Buddhism, 
  there are Three Heavenly Realms that contain Twenty-Eight Heavens. <br>

<p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> One question that is often asked is, 
  &quot;What happens to us after death?&quot; According to the Buddhists, rebirth 
  takes place at the end of this life. Buddhists regard rebirth as a fact. There 
  is evidence that each person has lived many lives in the past and will continue 
  to lives more in the future. <br>
  <br>
  ________________________________________<br>
  <font size="5">The Case for Rebirth </font><br>
  <br>
  Rebirth is a reality although one may not be aware of it. The existence of past 
  lives has been confirmed by those who have developed their minds through meditation. 
  Meditators who has attained powers of concentration have been able to recall 
  their previous lives in great detail. The Buddha and His prominent disciples 
  in many countries and at different times have been able to prove the existence 
  of past lives. The Buddha, on the night of His Enlightenment, developed the 
  ability to see His past lives. He also saw beings dying in one state of existence 
  and being reborn in another, according to their actions. Thus it was from personal 
  experience that the Buddha taught His followers the truth of rebirth. <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, evidence has been collected and documented, which confirm that 
  rebirth is a fact. There have been cases of people who have been able to recollect 
  their experience of previous lives. Their description of places and persons 
  of the past were confirmed after thorough investigations. <br>
  <br>
  The best known example of this is the case of Bridey Murphy. Mrs. Ruth Simmons 
  of the United States recollected a previous life in Ireland, more than 100 years 
  ago. She said she has been Bridey Murphy in the year 1789 and gave full details 
  of Bridey&#8217;s life. The details were later checked and found to be quite 
  accurate although in the present life, Mrs. Simmons had never been outside America. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In another case in England, a woman called Mrs. Naomi Henry recollected two 
  previous lives. In the first instance, she recalled her life as an Irishwoman 
  living in a village called Greehalgh in the seventeenth century. Research into 
  her case was carried out and this revealed that such a village did exist then. 
  In the second instance, she remembered that in one of her previous lives, she 
  was a Englishwoman who became a nurse to several children in an English town 
  called Downham in 1902. A search into the official records kept in Downham proved 
  that such a woman did exist. <br>
  <br>
  Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia, USA, has researched and 
  published his finding on over twenty cases of rebirth. These cases, which have 
  been well documented and verified, are form various countries including France, 
  Italy, India, Sri Lanka and Burma. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="435f13">_<a href="#rebirth">Back to Top</a>_______________________________________<br>
  <font size="5">Rebirth in the Six Realms </font><img src="Images/Six-Realms-of-Rebirth.gif" width="154" height="49"><a name="rebirthinthesixrealms"></a><br>
  Buddhism teaches that birth, death and rebirth are part of the continuing process 
  of change. This is similar to the continuous process of growth, decay and replacement 
  of cells in one&#8217;s body. According to medical expert, after every seven 
  years, all the cells in one&#8217;s body are replaced by new ones. <br>
  <br>
  At the moment of death, when this life is over, and the body can no longer survive, 
  the mind is separated from the body. At that time, the craving for lives causes 
  one to seek a new existence, and the karma done previously determine the place 
  of one&#8217;s rebirth. <br>
  <br>
  There are six realms in which one may be reborn after death. They are the realms 
  of gods (deva), the demigods (Asura), human beings, animals, hungry ghosts and 
  the hells. These are just general categories and within each, there exist many 
  sub-categories. The six realms of existence include three relatively happy states, 
  and three relatively miserable states. The realms of the gods, the demigods 
  and human beings are considered more happiness and less suffering. The realms 
  of animals, hungry ghosts and the hells are considered relatively miserable 
  because living beings there suffer more from fear, hunger, thirst, heat ,cold 
  and pain. <br>
  <br>
  In general, wholesome actions like good conduct, charity and mental development, 
  are the cause of rebirth in the happy realms of gods, demigods and human beings. 
  On the other hand, unwholesome actions like immoral conduct, miserliness and 
  cruelty cause rebirth in the unhappy realms of animals, hungry ghosts and the 
  hells. <br>
  <br>
  One need not wait until one is reborn to imagine what existence in other realms 
  is like. For instance, when one is intensely happy or totally at peace with 
  oneself, one experience a state similar to that of the gods. When one follows 
  one baser instincts and is totally preoccupied with eating, sleeping and sex, 
  one&#8217;s existence is like that of the animals. Then again, when one is overwhelmed 
  by fear and pain, or is tortured and killed in this life, one experience suffering 
  like that of the hells. <br>
  <br>
  Of all the six realms, the realm of human beings is considered the most desirable. 
  In the realm of human beings, the conditions for attaining Nirvana are better. 
  In general, in the unhappy realms, the suffering of living beings is so intense 
  and their ignorance so great that they are unable to recognise the Truth and 
  follow the path to attain freedom. Alternatively, living beings in the realms 
  of the gods and demigods experience so much happiness and have so many distractions 
  that they do no think of rebirth until is too late. Then they may be reborn 
  in one of the lower realms of suffering. In the realm of human beings, however, 
  people experience both happiness and suffering, and are intelligent enough to 
  recognise the Truth and follow the path to attain freedom from the cycle of 
  birth and death. Therefore, one is indeed fortunate to be born as a human being, 
  and should remember that the principal cause of birth in this realm is Good 
  Conduct. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="#">Back to Top</a>________________________________________<br>
  <font size="5">The Cycle of Birth and Death </font><br>
  <br>
  The Buddha pointed out that whenever one is reborn, whether as a human beings, 
  as an animal, or as a god, non of these states of existence is permanent. The 
  average life span of the living beings in the six realms of existence differ 
  but none of them lasts forever. Eventually, rebirth will take place. The realm 
  into which one is reborn and one&#8217;s conditions of rebirth are determined 
  by one&#8217;s past and present actions. This is the law of karma at work. <br>
  <br>
  Because of the force of their karma, people are born and reborn endlessly, in 
  one realm of existence or in another. The Buddha declared that there is no permanent 
  rest in this cycle of birth and death. It is only when one follows the Noble 
  Eightfold path taught by the Buddha and eventually attains Nirvana, that one 
  finally becomes free from this ceaseless cycle and gains supreme and permanent 
  happiness. <br>
  <br>
  People who understand karma and rebirth see life in a better perspective. They 
  understand that every action they perform will have its effects now and in the 
  future. The knowledge gives them hope and strength in the face of difficulties. 
  It gives them courage to continue doing good. They are convinced that they will 
  experience the good effects of their wholesome actions either in the short-term 
  or in the long-term. </font></p>
