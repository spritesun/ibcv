<p align="justify"><font color="435f13">It has been more than one thousand and 
  nine hundred years since Buddhism spread to China. Thus, the relationship between 
  Buddhism and China is very close. The development of Buddhism influenced, and 
  was influenced by Chinese culture. In fact Buddhism became a religion of the 
  Chinese. <br>
  <br>
  Buddhism originated from India, and the special characteristics of the Indian 
  culture were sometimes not easy for the Chinese to understand. The Chinese traditions 
  influenced and modified some of the practices, and these deviated from the teaching 
  of the Buddha. As a result, there are unfortunately many misunderstandings about 
  Buddhism in China among the Buddhists and non-Buddhists. <br>
  <br>
  It is very easy to misunderstand Buddhism if one knows nothing about its origins. 
  Some followers may practice the cultural rituals without ever knowing Buddha&#8217;s 
  teachings. As a consequence, those who believe in &quot;Buddhism&quot; may not 
  really be following the Buddha&#8217;s teachings, and those who criticise Buddhism 
  may not actually be criticising what the Buddha taught. So I hope this talk 
  may help everyone gain a better understanding! <br>
  <br>
  <strong>________________________________________</strong><br>
  <font size="+1"><a name="misunderstanding"></a>1. Misunderstanding that arises 
  from the teachings </font><br>
  The theory of the Buddha&#8217;s teaching is very profound. Some people do not 
  understand its meanings and may only know it superficially. After listening 
  to a few phrases, they may start to explain to the others in their own way. 
  As a result, some explanations people tell, may not be accurate teachings of 
  the Buddha. The most common misunderstandings are about the teachings: &quot;life 
  is suffering&quot;, &quot;out-worldly&quot; and &quot;emptiness&quot;. So now 
  lets discuss these terminologies separately: <br>
  <br>
  <strong>a) Life is suffering<br>
  </strong><br>
  The Buddha told us that &quot;Life is Suffering&quot;. One who does not understand 
  the Truth of this may think that life is meaningless and become negative and 
  pessimistic. Actually, this theory is commonly misunderstood. People in society 
  and even some Buddhists are trapped in this wrong and gloomy view. <br>
  <br>
  When we encounter phenomena, and have a feeling of dislike, worry or pain, we 
  say that there is &quot;suffering&quot;. This should not be generalised to &quot;all 
  life is suffering&quot;, because there is also a lot of happiness in life! Noises 
  are disturbing but nice melodies bring happiness. When one is sick, poor, separated 
  from loved ones, one has suffering. But when one is healthy, wealthy, together 
  with one&#8217;s family, one is very happy. Suffering and happiness exist in 
  all phenomena. Actually where there is happiness, there will be suffering. They 
  are in contrast with each other. If&#8217; we only say that life is suffering 
  when things do not go according to our wish we are rather foolish. <br>
  <br>
  The Buddha says, &quot;Life is suffering&quot;. What does &quot;suffering&quot; 
  mean? The sutras say: &quot;Impermanence therefore suffering&quot;. Everything 
  is impermanent and changeable. The Buddha says that life is suffering because 
  it is impermanent and ever-changing. For example, a healthy body cannot last 
  forever. It will gradually become weak, old. sick and die. One who is wealthy 
  cannot maintain one&#8217;s wealth forever. Sometimes one may become poor. Power 
  and status do not last as well, one will lose them finally. From this condition 
  of changing and instability, although there is happiness and joy, they are not 
  ever lasting and ultimate. When changes come, suffering arises. <br>
  <br>
  Thus, the Buddha says life is suffering. Suffering means dissatisfaction, impermanence 
  and imperfection. If a practising Buddhist does not understand the real meaning 
  of &quot;suffering&quot; and think that life is not perfect and ultimate, they 
  become negative and pessimistic in their view of life. Those who really understand 
  the teaching of the Buddha will have a totally different view. We should know 
  that the theory of &quot;Life is suffering&quot; taught by the Buddha is to 
  remind us that life is not ultimate and lasting, and hence we should strive 
  towards Buddhahood &#8212; a permanent and perfect life. <br>
  <br>
  This is similar to one who is sick. One must know that one is sick before wanting 
  to seek the doctor&#8217;s treatment. Only then can the sickness be cured. Why 
  is life not ultimate and permanent and full of suffering? There must be a cause 
  for the suffering. Once one knows the cause of suffering, one will try one&#8217;s 
  best to be rid of the causes, and hence end the suffering and attain ultimate 
  peacefulness and happiness. <br>
  <br>
  A practising Buddhist should practice according to the Buddha&#8217;s instruction, 
  and change this imperfect and non-ultimate life to a ultimate and perfect one. 
  Then would come a state of permanent joy, personality, and purity. <br>
  <br>
  Permanent means ever-lasting, joy means peacefulness and happiness, personality 
  means freedom and non-attachment, purity means cleanliness. This highest aim 
  of Buddhism is not only to break through the suffering of life but to transform 
  this suffering life into a life that has permanent peacefulness, joy, freedom 
  and purity. The Buddha told us the cause of suffering and instructed us to strive 
  towards the goal. The stage of permanent, joy, personality and purity is an 
  ultimate ideal phenomena. It is full of brightness and hope. It is a stage that 
  is attainable by all of us. How can we say that Buddhism is negative and pessimistic? 
  <br>
  <br>
  Although not all practising Buddhists are able to attain this highest point 
  of practice, there is still boundless benefit in knowing this theory. Most people 
  know that they have to strive to do good when they are poor, but once they become 
  rich, they forget about everything, and only think about their own enjoyment 
  and hence walk towards the wrong path foolishly. <br>
  <br>
  A practising Buddhist should remember to strive not only when one is poor and 
  in difficulties, but should also be mindful when one is enjoying, because happiness 
  is not permanent. If one does not strive towards the good, they will degenerate 
  and fall very quickly. The teaching of &quot;Life is suffering&quot; reminds 
  us not to look forward for enjoyment only and go the wrong way. This is the 
  important implication in the teaching of &quot;Life is suffering&quot;, taught 
  by the Buddha. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>b. &quot;Out worldly&quot; (Supra mundane) </strong><br>
  <br>
  The teaching of Buddha tells us that there is this world and the world beyond 
  this. Many people think that this world refers to the world that we are living 
  in and the world beyond this is some place outside this world. This is wrong. 
  We are living in this world and we remain here even if we become monks or nuns. 
  The Arahats, Bodhisattva and Buddha are saints who have realisations beyond 
  this world but they are still living in this world and giving assistance to 
  us. Thus, &quot;out-worldly&quot; does not mean that one has to go away from 
  this world and go to another place. <br>
  <br>
  What does &quot;worldly&quot; and &quot;out-worldly&quot; mean in Buddhism? 
  According to the Chinese understanding &quot;worldly&quot; has the implication 
  of time. For example, the Chinese regard thirty years as an &quot;age&quot; 
  and in the West, a hundred years make up a century. Anything that exists within 
  the time frame, from the past to the present and from the present to the future, 
  is the &quot;world&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  The teaching of the Buddha is also as such. That which is changeable is called 
  &quot;worldly&quot;. Within this time frame, from the past to the present, from 
  the present to the future, from existence to non-existence, from good to bad, 
  everything is changing continuously. Anything that is changing is called &quot;worldly&quot;. 
  Besides, the word &quot;worldly&quot; also has the meaning of concealment. Normal 
  people do not understand the cause and effect of the past, present and future. 
  They do not know where they come from, how to behave as a human being, where 
  to go after death, the meaning of life and the nature of the universe. They 
  live ignorantly under the influence of the karma of the three births. This is 
  called &quot;worldly&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  What does &quot;out-worldly&quot; (supra mundane) mean? &quot;Out&quot; has 
  the meaning of beyond or superior. One who practices the teaching of the Buddha, 
  has wisdom and is able to understand the truth of the life and universe; has 
  no defilements and is pure in one&#8217;s mind; and experiences the permanent 
  Truth is called the &quot;out-worldly&quot; one. All the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 
  are living in this world. They have great wisdom in seeing the Truth and their 
  minds are pure. They are not like the normal &quot;worldly&quot; people. <br>
  <br>
  Thus, the term &quot;out-worldly&quot; encourages all of us who are practising 
  the Buddha&#8217;s teaching to progress further and become the man above the 
  men, to improve ourselves from a worldly person to an out-worldly saint. It 
  is not asking us to go to another world. Misunderstanding &quot;out-worldly&quot;, 
  some think that the principle of Buddhism is to run away from reality. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>c. Emptiness </strong><br>
  <br>
  The Buddha says that everything is &quot;empty&quot;. Some think that this is 
  empty, that is empty, or everything is empty. Since everything is empty, and 
  meaningless, one does not need to do either evil or good. These people understand 
  the concept vaguely, and lead an aimless life. In fact, &quot;emptiness&quot; 
  in Buddhism is the most profound philosophy. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are 
  the people who have realised the truth of emptiness. &quot;Emptiness&quot; does 
  not mean nothing at all, in contrast, it includes everything. The world is world, 
  life is life, suffering is suffering, happiness is happiness, everything does 
  exist. <br>
  <br>
  In Buddhism, there is clear teaching as to what is right or wrong, good or evil, 
  or cause and effect. One should turn away from the wrong one and redirect to 
  the right one, refrain from evil and do more good. Those who do good will gain 
  good effect, and if one practices one may attain Buddhahood. This is the cause 
  and effect. If we say that everything is empty, then why are we practising the 
  teaching of the Buddha? If there exist the karma, good and evil, worldly people 
  and saint, then, why does the Buddha say that everything is empty? What is the 
  meaning of emptiness? <br>
  <br>
  Things exist due to causes and conditions and do not have a real and unchangeable 
  identity of itself. Thus, they are &quot;empty&quot;. The right and wrong, good 
  and evil, and the life are not permanent and unchangeable. They exist due to 
  causes and conditions. Since their existence is dependent on causes and conditions, 
  they continue to change with the changes of the causes and conditions. They 
  do not have a permanent form, and therefore they are &quot;empty&quot;. <br>
  <br>
  For example, when one is facing a mirror, there will be an image in the mirror. 
  The image is produced by various conditions. It is not a real thing. Although 
  it is not real, it is very clear when we see it. We cannot say that it does 
  not exist. The concept of &quot;emptiness&quot; relies on this truth that things 
  arise due to causes and conditions. Thus, when the Buddha says that everything 
  is empty, he is implying that everything arises due to causes and conditions. 
  A practising Buddhist must realise and experience emptiness and understand the 
  existence of the Law of cause and effect, good and evil. The perfect realisation 
  of the two truths is that emptiness and existence are equivalent. <br>

  ________________________________________<br>
  <font size="+1"><a name="misunderstanding2"></a>2. Misunderstanding that arises 
  from the system </font><br>
  <br>
  Buddhism originated from India. Its custom were different from the traditional 
  customs of China. For example, the understanding of the aspects of renunciation 
  and vegetarianism were different. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>a) To renounce (To take the vows of a monk or nun) </strong><br>
  <br>
  To renounce is a custom in Indian Buddhism. In Chinese society, especially for 
  the Confucianists, there are a lot of misunderstandings about this. <br>
  <br>
  In China, we always hear that, if everyone practised the teaching of the Buddha, 
  then this world would become extinct. Why is it so? Because everyone would become 
  monks or nuns (celibate). There would be no husband and wife, nor son and daughter. 
  How then could society survive? <br>
  <br>
  This is a very serious misunderstanding. There is an example: The teachers teach 
  the students. Will they encourage everyone to be a teacher, and therefore develop 
  a world of teachers? In the Philippines, there is not much misunderstanding 
  about this because there are Fathers and Sisters everywhere. They have also 
  taken vows, but they are only the minority among the Catholics. Not all Catholics 
  must be a Father or Sister. <br>
  <br>
  For the Buddhists, there are the renounced ones and the lay people. One can 
  practise Buddhism by renouncing, or as a lay person. One can practise in order 
  to end the cycle of life and death by renouncing, and can also achieve the same 
  aim by practising at home. It is not necessary for Buddhists renounce themselves. 
  It is also not true that if everyone became a Buddhist, the world of the humans 
  would become extinct. The question now will be, if one can attain the aim of 
  ending the cycle of life and death by either practising as a lay person or as 
  renounced follower, then why must one to renounce? This is because, in order 
  to promote and encourage the spread of Buddhism, someone has to take the responsibility. 
  The best person to take charge of this responsibility will be the renounced 
  monks or nuns, as they do not have family responsibilities and are not involved 
  in other work duties. Hence, they can concentrate more on their practice and 
  the spreading of Buddhism. In order to prolong the existence of Buddhism in 
  this world, we need these type of people to take responsibility. This is also 
  the reason for the formation of the Sangha, the community of renounced ones. 
  <br>
  <br>
  How great is the merit of renouncing? The merit of renunciation is very great. 
  However, those who cannot renounce should not force themselves to do so. If 
  one cannot practise in line with the teaching of the Buddha after renouncing, 
  it is worse then a lay follower. The higher one climbs, the worse will one fall. 
  The merit of renouncing oneself is great, but if one is careless, one will deteriorate 
  even more. One should develop one&#8217;s mind sincerely, practise diligently 
  and sacrifice oneself for Buddhism. Then renunciation will be worthwhile. The 
  Sangha (the renounced monks or nuns) are the centre members of Buddhism, they 
  are the main force in the motivation of Buddhism. <br>
  <br>
  The practice of not getting married can also be found in the Western religions. 
  A lot of scientists and philosophers also remain single so that they will not 
  be disturbed by the matters in the family, and hence they can concentrate more 
  on their studies and contribute more to the development of science and philosophy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The practice of renunciation in Buddhism is to get rid of one&#8217;s worldly 
  attachment, and hence concentrate more on Buddhism. To renounce is an act of 
  a great person, thus, one must put in extra effort. If one renounces without 
  proper understanding, or without pure aims, one will not gain any benefit but 
  will obstruct the development of Buddhism. <br>
  Some people want to renounce just after they begin to practice. They think that 
  in order to practice the teaching of the Buddha, one must renounce. This is 
  not correct and may frighten away the others from stepping into the practice 
  of Buddhism. This kind of thought &#8212; that one must renounce in order to 
  practice the Buddha&#8217;s teaching, is the thought that all of us should avoid. 
  One should recognise that it is not easy to renounce. One should first practise 
  to be a good lay follower, practise for the sake of the Dharma, benefiting oneself 
  and others. If one can develop one&#8217;s mind greatly and sincerely, practise 
  the renounced way, contribute to Buddhism first before one decides to renounce, 
  it will be better for oneself and at the same time will not create any unpleasant 
  influence to the society. <br>
  <strong><br>
  With regards to renunciation, there are two points to mention here: </strong><br>
  <br>
  a) Some people observe the spaciousness, majestic appearance, quietness and 
  beauty of the temples and monasteries, and this arouses their admiration to 
  be renounced. They think that the monks and nuns who live inside there are just 
  waiting for the offerings of the devotees and enjoying themselves. They do not 
  need to do any work. The idioms such as &quot;do not wake up even when the sun 
  has risen up to three metre high&quot;, or &quot;cannot compare with even half-a-day&#8217;s 
  freedom of the monk or nun&quot; show the misunderstandings among the general 
  people. <br>
  <br>
  They do not know that the monks and nuns have their own responsibilities, they 
  need to strive hard. When they are practising themselves, they have to &quot;practice 
  diligently before and after midnight&quot;; and in terms of their duty to the 
  devotees, they should go around to preach the teaching of the Buddha. They lead 
  a simple and hard life, striving for the benefit of Buddhism and all beings, 
  benefiting one and another. This is something very great. Thus, they are called 
  the Gem of Sangha. They are not just sitting there waiting for the devotees 
  offerings, waiting for things which are ready and never do anything. May be 
  it is because of too many monks or nuns who are not fulfilling their responsibilities 
  that leads to this misunderstanding. <br>
  <br>
  Some people who are against Buddhism say that the monks and nuns do nothing, 
  they are parasites of society and are useless. These people do not know that 
  it is not necessary for one to be engaged in the work force of agriculture or 
  business in order to be considered productive. If it is so, then are people 
  who choose to be teacher, reporter or other occupations also considered as the 
  consumers of society&#8217;s output too? <br>
  <br>
  It is not right to say that the monks or nuns have nothing to do. They lead 
  a simple and hard life and striving diligently everyday. The things that they 
  do, besides benefiting themselves, is to teach others to do good, to emphasise 
  moral values and practices, so that the personality of the devotees can be improved, 
  leading them to the end of the cycle of life and death. They bring great benefit 
  to the people in the world. Thus, how can we say that they are the parasites 
  that are doing nothing? <br>
  The monks and nuns are religious teachers. They are profound and respectful 
  educators. Thus, the saying of those who have no understanding on Buddhism, 
  that the monks and nuns are doing nothing and are the parasites wasting society&#8217;s 
  money are in fact wrong. A person who really leads a renounced life is in fact 
  not free, they are not mere consumers but are busily repaying their gratitude 
  to all living beings whenever they can. <br>
  <br>
  b) Chinese Buddhism emphasises a vegetarian diet. Thus, some people thought 
  that one who practises Buddhism must be a vegetarian. People who cannot stop 
  eating meat misunderstood that they are not ready to start to learn about Buddhism. 
  If we look around at the Buddhists in Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand or Tibet and 
  Mongolia, not to mention the lay followers, we find even the monks and nuns 
  have meat in their diet. Can you say that they are not practising the Buddha&#8217;s 
  teaching? They are not Buddhists? <br>
  <br>
  Do not think that one must be a vegetarian in order to learn about the teaching 
  of the Buddha and that one cannot practise Buddhism if one cannot be a vegetarian. 
  To practice Buddhism and be a vegetarian are not the same thing. Some people 
  who become a Buddhist, do not learn much about the teachings but only know how 
  to be a vegetarian. This causes unhappiness among the members of the family. 
  They feel that it is too troublesome to be a vegetarian. <br>
  <br>
  In fact one who is practising the teaching of the Buddha should: - after becoming 
  a Buddhist - first understand the teaching of the Buddha and behave according 
  to the teaching in both the family and the society. Purifying one&#8217;s conduct 
  and mind, so that the members of the family feel that one has changed for the 
  better should be the goal. If before becoming a Buddhist, one was greedy, has 
  strong hatred and lacked of a sense of responsibility and loving kindness; and 
  after practising the Buddha&#8217;s teaching, one becomes less greedy, less 
  paranoid and shows more care to the others with a stronger sense of responsibility, 
  then the members of the family would see the benefit of practising the Buddha&#8217;s 
  teaching. At that time, if one wants to be a vegetarian, the family members 
  would not object to it. In fact, they may also be encouraged to have sympathy 
  towards other living beings and follow one to be a vegetarian. If one only knows 
  to be a vegetarian after becoming a Buddhist and does not learn about others, 
  one will surely encounter obstacles and cause misunderstanding. <br>
  <br>
  Although it is not necessary for a Buddhist to be vegetarian, it is a good moral 
  conduct in the Chinese Buddhism and is something that should be promoted. The 
  teaching of the Buddha says that becoming a vegetarian will cultivate one&#8217;s 
  loving kindness and compassion. By not harming the life of other living beings, 
  not eating the meat of the other animals one will reduce one&#8217;s karma of 
  killing and strengthen one&#8217;s sympathy towards the sufferings of Mankind. 
  Mahayana Buddhism advocates the practice of vegetarianism, and says that to 
  be a vegetarian has great merits in cultivating one&#8217;s mind of loving kindness 
  and compassion. If one becomes a vegetarian but does not cultivate the mind 
  of loving kindness and compassion, it is only a practice of no killing in a 
  pessimistic way. It resembles the practice of the Hinayanist. <br>
  <br>
  From the view point of the worldly Dharma, the benefit of becoming a vegetarian 
  is very great. It is more economical, highly nutritious and may reduce illness. 
  In the world at present, there are international vegetarian organisations. Everyone 
  who likes to be a vegetarian may join them. Thus, it can be seen that it is 
  good to be a vegetarian. And as Buddhist who emphasises compassion, we should 
  advocate the practice more to others. However, one thing to note is that, do 
  not claim that a Buddhist must be a vegetarian. Whenever meeting with a Buddhist, 
  some will ask: have you become a vegetarian? Why are you still not a vegetarian 
  after practising the Buddha&#8217;s teaching for so long? This will frighten 
  some people away. To regard practising Buddhism and becoming a vegetarian as 
  the same will in fact obstruct the spreading of Buddhism. <br>

  <font size="+1"><a name="misunderstanding3"></a>3. The misunderstanding that 
  arises due to the observances </font><br>
  <br>
  When non-Buddhists visit the monastery and see observances such as paying respect 
  to the Buddha, intoning the sutras, repenting and the morning and evening chanting, 
  they cannot understand the meaning behind them and comment that these are superstitious 
  acts. There are many misunderstanding within this category. Now, lets briefly 
  mention some of them: <br>
  <br>
  <strong>a) To pay respects to the Buddha </strong><br>
  <br>
  To pay respects to the Buddha when entering the monastery, to offer incense, 
  flowers, candle and light to the Buddha are the observances of the Buddhist. 
  The Theistic followers say that we are idol worshippers and superstitious In 
  reality, the Buddha is the master of our religion, he is the saint who has attained 
  the perfect and ultimate stage by practising from the stage of a worldly being. 
  The great Bodhisattvas are the Buddhas to be. They are our guides and indicators 
  of refuge. We should be polite in showing respect to the Buddha and Bodhisattva 
  just as when we show respect to our parents. When the Buddha was still in this 
  world, there was no problem. One could show one&#8217;s respect to him directly. 
  However, now that the Sakyamuni Buddha has already entered final Nirvana; and 
  the Buddha and Bodhisattva of the other worlds are not in our world, we have 
  no way to pay respects. Thus, we have to use paper to draw, ceramic, wood or 
  stone to carve their images, to be the object of our worship. It is because 
  of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, merits and images that we are paying our respect 
  to them, and not because of they are the paper, earth wood or stone. <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to the way we respect and love our country. We use coloured cloth 
  and make it into a flag. When the flag is flying, we pay respects to the flag. 
  Can we say that this is also a superstitious act? The Catholics also have images 
  in their church. The Christians, have no image of the God, but use the &quot;cross&quot; 
  as the image for them to pay respect to. Some even kneel down and say their 
  prayer. What is the difference between these acts and the paying of respects 
  to the Buddha? To say that the paying of respects in Buddhism is idol worshipping, 
  is just the intentional defamation of some people. <br>
  <br>
  What about the offerings of fragrance flowers, light and candle? During the 
  Buddha time, the Indians offered these to the Buddha. Light and candle represent 
  brightness, flowers represent fragrance and cleanliness. We believe in the Buddha 
  and pay respect to the Buddha. The offering of these things to the Buddha is 
  to show our respect and faith. On the other hand, it means the gaining of brightness 
  and purity from the Buddha. We do not offer flowers and incense so that the 
  Buddha smells the fragrance; or offer light and candle so that the Buddha can 
  see everything. <br>
  <br>
  Some religions, for example the Catholics, also use these things in their offerings. 
  These are in fact the common observances among the religions. When we are paying 
  respect to the Buddha, we should be respectful and sincere and contemplate on 
  the merits of the real Buddha. If one thinks of other things or talks while 
  paying respect to the Buddha, it is not respectful and loses the meaning of 
  the act of paying respect. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>b) To repent </strong><br>
  The non-Buddhist or free thinkers always feel that it is an act of superstition 
  when they see Buddhists repent or chant. To repent is to admit one&#8217;s mistake. 
  Everyone of us, from the past until the present, have committed countless wrong 
  and evil deeds. We have left behind the karma that brings us sufferings and 
  obstructs our progress towards enlightenment and freedom. In order to reduce 
  and get rid of this karma that is obstructing and bringing suffering to us, 
  we should repent in front of the Buddha or the Sangha and admit our mistakes, 
  so that the past evil karma can be reduced. There are methods of repentance 
  in Buddhism and these are equivalent to the confession&#8217; in Christianity. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This practice is very important for us to progress further along the path of 
  Buddhahood. One must repent for oneself with great sincerity. Then this repentance 
  can be beneficial and comply with the teaching of the Buddha. <br>
  <br>
  People generally do not know how to repent. So, what should we do? The great 
  masters in the past thus compiled some procedures and observances that one could 
  follow if one wants to repent. They taught us to chant word by word, contemplate 
  and understand the teaching behind it. The services of repentance teaches us 
  how to pay respect to the Buddha, seeking for the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas, 
  loving kindness and compassionate protection. We should admit our own mistakes, 
  knowing that killing, stealing and adultery are evil deeds, sincerely repenting 
  our past evil deeds and be determined to practice for a better future. These 
  are the procedures of repentance taught by the great masters in the past. However, 
  the most important aim of these services is to develop one&#8217;s mind to correcting 
  oneself and repent sincerely for one&#8217;s past evil deeds. <br>
  <br>
  Some people cannot even read the readily written procedures, hence, they invite 
  the monks or nuns to lead them during the repentance. As time passes, it gradually 
  turns out to be that these people do not even know that they should repent, 
  and only employ the monks and nuns to repent for them. Some, when their parents 
  or family members pass away, in order to release the past evil karma of the 
  parents and the other family members, invite the monks or nuns to do a repentance 
  service for them. They hope that relying on the merits of the Triple Gem, the 
  death may be relieved from the realms of suffering. However, sometimes they 
  do not understand the real purpose of the teaching and only emphasise on how 
  big the ceremony should be; or do it for the sake of tradition, and spend money 
  to employ the monks or nuns to do the services for them. They do not have faith 
  in Buddhism, and do not show any sincerity in repenting themselves. In this 
  case the purpose of these repentance services will not be achieved. <br>
  <br>
  Gradually, the purpose of the services for repentance becomes vague. The Buddhist 
  devotees do not repent and request the monks or nuns to do everything for them, 
  As a result, the monks and nuns are busy with all these services all day; to 
  do the service for this family today, and the next family tomorrow. And these 
  services become the only activity in some of the monasteries, with the main 
  task of the monks and nuns being neglected. This is one of the causes of lack 
  of faith in Buddhism nowadays. <br>
  <br>
  Repentance has to come from within. If one repents sincerely, even for just 
  an hour, it has better merits than inviting a lot of people and conducting a 
  few days services but not repenting oneself. If one understands this theory, 
  and would like to show one&#8217;s filial piety to the one&#8217;s parents, 
  the best merit will be to do the repentance oneself. It is not right to regard 
  the services of repentance or other services as the occupation of the monks 
  or nuns, as this will not bring any good to the society, but creates more misunderstanding 
  and defamation for Buddhism. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>c) Daily Chanting </strong><br>
  Some people who practices the teaching of the Buddha, recite the name of the 
  Buddha and chant the sutras every morning and evening as their daily homework. 
  This is what we call daily chanting (prayer) in Buddhism. <br>
  <br>
  In Christianity, they have morning and evening, and meal time prayer. The Catholic 
  also chants in the morning and evening. There is nothing wrong with these religious 
  ceremonies, but some Buddhists were concerned about these matters and asked: 
  &quot;Maybe it is better not to practice Buddhism. Once one practices Buddhism, 
  problems come. My mother spends at least one to two hours each morning and evening 
  to do her chanting. If all practising Buddhists are like this, then who is going 
  to do the work at home?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Among some of the lay people, this is the real situation. They create the misunderstanding 
  that Buddhism is only suitable for the old people and those who are free, it 
  is not suitable for the general people to practice. In fact, it is not necessary 
  that one must chant a specific sutra, or recite a certain Buddha&#8217;s name 
  or to intone for a long time. One can practise according to one&#8217;s wish. 
  The duration of the practice should depend on the circumstances and the time 
  that one has. The important thing in the daily practices is to recite the verse 
  of taking refuge in the Triple Gem. The &quot;Ten Vows of the Pu Xian Bodhisattva&quot; 
  is also important. The Buddhism sect in Japan, such as the Pure Land sect, the 
  Tien Tai sect and the Secret sect, which originated from China, have the daily 
  practices of their own sect. They are simple and do not require too much time. 
  This was the situation of Buddhism during the Tang and Song Dynasties. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The daily practice in China over the last few centuries varied: </strong><br>
  <br>
  i) In the forest monastery where there were hundreds of people, it took a long 
  time to gather everyone together. In order to adapt to this special environment, 
  the daily practices became longer. <br>
  <br>
  ii) Since the Yuen and Ming dynasties, the different sects in Buddhism merged. 
  Thus, in compiling the procedure of the daily practice, it included the practices 
  of the various sects in order to suit the needs of followers. It is not necessary 
  for a lay person now to follow all these procedures. In the older days, the 
  Indians who practised the Mahayana teachings practised the Five Repentances 
  six times per day. It does not matter if the time is shorter. The frequency 
  of the practice may be increased. <br>
  <br>
  In short, to practice the teaching of the Buddha is not to chant only; and for 
  one who is practising at home, one should not neglect one&#8217;s responsibilities 
  at home because of long daily practices. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>d) To burn paper money after a death </strong><br>
  <br>
  The Chinese in the olden days have the tradition of burning white silk when 
  praying to the ancestors. They burn the silk so that the ancestors may use it. 
  They were then replaced by paper; as it is more economical. Later, they used 
  paper to make money, ingots, notes, and even houses and cars, and burn them 
  for their ancestors. These are generated from the traditional customs of the 
  olden days. They are not the teachings of the Buddha. <br>
  <br>
  However, there are also some good points about this. It allows the children 
  to show appreciation to their parents. When they are drinking or eating, they 
  think of their parents and ancestors. When they are living in good houses and 
  wearing nice clothes, they remember their ancestors, and do not forget the help 
  of their ancestors. This practice has the implication of remembrance. When Buddhism 
  spread to China, in order to adapt to the Chinese culture, and for convenience 
  sake, this practice was merged into the practice of chanting and paying respect 
  to the Buddha. It arouses the criticism of others, and thoughts that Buddhism 
  is superstitious and wasteful. Buddhists should understand this and should not 
  burn paper money as this is not the teaching of the Buddha. If one still wants 
  to keep the tradition and want to show one&#8217;s remembrance towards the ancestors, 
  then one may burn a little at home. But do not burn them in the temple or monastery 
  as this will create misunderstanding of Buddhism. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>e) To draw lots, to ask for fortune, to divine </strong><br>
  <br>
  In some Buddhist monasteries and temple, there is misbehaviour such as drawing 
  lots, asking for fortune, divining etc. This arouses the criticism and ire of 
  the society, and people say that Buddhism is superstitious. In fact, true Buddhists 
  do not allow this behaviour (whether they are effective or not is another matter). 
  One who is really practising the teaching of the Buddha, should believe in the 
  Law of Cause and Effect. If one has committed evil karma in the past or present 
  lives, one will not be able to avoid the effect of it through any methods. <br>
  <br>
  One who practises good acts will gain good fruit. One who does evil deeds will 
  not be able to run away from the evil effects. In order to gain good effects, 
  one must do more merits. A practising Buddhist should try to do more good deeds, 
  according to the teaching of the Buddha, and should not try to find short cuts 
  and behave in a bad way. <br>

  ________________________________________<br>
  <font size="+1"><a name="misunderstanding4"></a>4. Misunderstanding that arises 
  from the current development of Buddhism </font><br>
  Many Chinese do not understand Buddhism and its development in the international 
  level. They criticise Buddhism on their own accord and opinion, based on the 
  current situation of Buddhism in China. The following are two commonly heard 
  criticisms: <br>
  <strong><br>
  a) The country will weaken and end if the people believe in Buddhism </strong><br>
  <br>
  They think that the end of India is due to its people&#8217;s belief in Buddhism. 
  They want China too strong and hence subjectively conclude that the people should 
  not believe in Buddhism. In fact this is totally wrong. Those who have studied 
  the history of Buddhism will know that the time when India was strongest was 
  during the time when Buddhism was most popular. At the time of Emperor Asoka, 
  he unified the whole India and spread the teaching of the Buddha to the whole 
  world. <br>
  Later, with the revival of the Brahmana practice, Buddhism was destroyed and 
  India became more restless each day. When India was conquered by the Muslims 
  and the British, Buddhism has already deteriorated to the stage of near to non-existence. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Buddhism in the Chinese history also has a similar path. Now that we call the 
  overseas Chinese the &quot;People of the Tang&quot;, and to call China as the 
  &quot;Mountain of Tang&quot;, shows that the Tang dynasty was the strongest 
  dynasty in the history of China. And, that is in fact the time when Buddhism 
  was at its high peak: After the destruction of Buddhism by Emperor Tang Wu Zhong, 
  the Tang dynasty began to deteriorate. After the Tang dynasty, the Song Emperors, 
  Song Tai Chu, Tai Zhong, Zhen Zhong and Ren Zhong were all faithful followers 
  of Buddhism. That was also the peak period of the Song dynasty. For the Ming 
  Emperor, the Ming Tai Chu had had the experience of leading a renounced life, 
  the Tai Zhong was also very faithful to Buddhism. Weren&#8217;t these the times 
  when the country was in good order, peaceful and strong? <br>
  <br>
  Although Japan is facing failure at the moment, they became one of the stronger 
  countries in the world sometime after the Ming Zhi Revolution. Then, they were 
  mostly Buddhist. Thus, who says that Buddhism will weaken a country? From the 
  facts in the history, the time when a nation was strong was also the time when 
  Buddhism was at its peak. Why are people wishing that the Chinese nation can 
  become stronger but at the same time condemn the propagation of Buddhism? <br>
  <br>
  <strong>b) Buddhism is useless to society </strong><br>
  <br>
  The Chinese this century, see the Catholic and Christians&#8217; contribution 
  in setting up schools and hospitals, but little is being seen to be done by 
  the Buddhists. Hence they feel that Buddhism is pessimistic and does not contribute 
  to the social welfare of the society. This is a wrong concept. The most that 
  one can say is that Chinese Buddhists this century were not hard working and 
  responsible. This is not the attitude that the Buddha taught us to have. <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Buddhist in the past also participated in the social welfare activities 
  in the society. In Japan, Buddhists are at present setting up a lot of universities 
  and high schools. The monks and nuns are the principals or lecturers of the 
  universities or high schools. The charitable work of the society is also conducted 
  and organised by the Sangha of the monastery or temple. This is especially so 
  in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. The Buddhists in these countries maintain 
  a very close relationship with the development of education and other charitable 
  work in the society. <br>
  <br>
  Thus, one cannot say that Buddhism is not bringing benefit to the society, one 
  can only say that the Chinese Buddhists have not fulfilled their responsibilities 
  or acted as true followers of the Buddha. One should put more effort into these 
  areas of charity in order to fulfil the basic teaching of the Buddha in relieving 
  the sufferings of the world, and hence increase the popularity of Buddhism. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately many Chinese do not understand Buddhism well. Today we have discussed 
  some of the common criticisms. I hope this has enabled you to understand better 
  the wisdom of the Buddha&#8217;s teachings. I hope too, that you may practise 
  according to the Buddha&#8217;s example, rather than allowing yourself to blindly 
  follow meaningless and perhaps, unhelpful rituals. </font></p>
