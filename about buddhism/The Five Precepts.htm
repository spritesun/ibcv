  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q1"></a>1.QUESTION: </strong>Other religions derive their ideas 
  of right and wrong from the commandments of their god or gods. You Buddhists 
  don&#8217;t believe in a god, so how do you know what is right and wrong? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>Any thoughts, speech or 
  actions that are rooted in greed, hatred and delusion and thus lead us away 
  from Nirvana are bad and any thoughts, speech or actions that are rooted in 
  giving, love and wisdom and thus help clear the way to Nirvana are good. <br>
  <br>
  To know what is right and wrong in god-centred religions, all that is needed 
  is to do as you are told. But in a man-centred religion like Buddhism, to know 
  what is right or wrong, you have to develop a deep self-awareness and self-understanding. 
  And ethics based on understanding are always stronger than those that are a 
  response to a command. <br>
  <br>
  So to know what is right and wrong, the Buddhist looks at three things &#8211; 
  the intention, the effect the act will have upon oneself and the effect it will 
  have upon others. If the intention is good (rooted in giving, love and wisdom), 
  if it helps myself (helps me to be more giving, more loving, and wiser) and 
  helps others (helps them to be more giving, more loving and wiser), then my 
  deeds and actions are wholesome, good and moral. Of course, there are many variations 
  of this. Sometimes I act with the best of intentions but it may not benefit 
  either myself or others. Sometimes my intentions are far from good, but my action 
  helps others nonetheless. Sometimes I act out of good intentions and my acts 
  help me but perhaps cause some distress to others. In such cases, my actions 
  are a mixed &#8211; a mixture of good and not-so-good. When intentions are bad 
  and the action helps neither myself nor others, such an action is bad. And when 
  my intention is good and my action benefits both myself and others, then the 
  deed is wholly good. <br>

  <strong><a name="Q2"></a>2.QUESTION: </strong>So does Buddhism have a code of 
  morality? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>Yes, it does. The Five 
  Precepts are the basis of Buddhist morality. The first precept is to avoid killing 
  or harming living beings. The second is to avoid stealing, the third is to avoid 
  sexual misconduct, the fourth is to avoid lying and the fifth is to avoid alcohol 
  and other intoxicating drugs. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q3"></a>3.QUESTION:</strong> But surely it is good to kill 
  sometimes. To kill disease-spreading insects, for example, or someone who is 
  going to kill you? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> It might be good for you. 
  But what about that thing or that person? They wish to live just as you do. 
  When you decide to kill a disease-spreading insect, your intention is perhaps 
  a mixture of self-concern (good) and revulsion (bad). The act will benefit yourself 
  (good) but obviously it will not benefit that creature (bad). So at times it 
  may be necessary to kill but it is never wholly good. <br>

  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q4"></a>4.QUESTION:</strong> You Buddhists are too concerned 
  about ants and bugs. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>Buddhists strive to develop 
  a compassion that is undiscriminating and all-embracing. They see the world 
  as a unified whole where each thing and creature has its place and function. 
  They believe that before we destroy or upset nature&#8217;s delicate balance, 
  we should be very careful. Just look at those cultures where emphasis is on 
  exploiting nature to the full, squeezing every last drop out of it without putting 
  anything back, conquering and subduing it. Nature has revolted. The very air 
  is becoming poisoned, the rivers are polluted and dead, so many beautiful animal 
  species are extinct, the slopes of the mountains are barren and eroded. Even 
  the climate is changing. If people were a little less anxious to crush, destroy 
  and kill, this terrible situation may not have arisen. We should all strive 
  to develop a little more respect for life. And this is what the first precept 
  is saying. <br>

  <strong><a name="Q5"></a>5.QUESTION: </strong>Buddhists should be vegetarians, 
  shouldn&#8217;t they? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>Not necessarily. Buddha 
  did not teach his disciples to be vegetarians and even today, there are many 
  good Buddhists who are not vegetarians. <br>
  <br>
  Out of loving kindness and compassion, Buddhists should try to be vegetarians. 
  One can do this progressively by reducing the quantity and variety of meat consumption 
  each day. <br>
  However, if becoming a full vegetarian is not possible or not possible for the 
  time being, Buddhists should avoid the following 3 types of meat: <br>
  <br>
  1) Meat of animals killed personally; <br>
  2) Meat of animals killed in the presence of you; <br>
  3) Meat of animals killed especially for your consumption. <br>
  <br>
  These 3 types of meat will cause heavy bad karma if consumed. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q6"></a>6.QUESTION:</strong> But if you eat meat you are indirectly 
  responsible for the death of a creature. Isn&#8217;t that breaking the first 
  precept? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>It is true that when you 
  eat meat, you are indirectly and partially responsible for killing a creature 
  but the same is true when you eat vegetables. The farmer has to spray his crop 
  with insecticides and poisons so that the vegetables arrive on your dinner plates 
  without holes in them. And once again, animals have been used to provide the 
  leather for your belt or handbag, oil for the soap you use and a thousand other 
  products as well. It is impossible to live without, in some way, being indirectly 
  responsible for the death of some other beings. This is just another example 
  of the First Noble Truth, ordinary existence is suffering and unsatisfactory. 
  When you take the First Precept, you try to avoid being directly responsible 
  for killing beings. <br>

  <strong><a name="Q7"></a>7.QUESTION: </strong>The Third Precept says we should 
  avoid sexual misconduct. What is sexual misconduct? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> If we use trickery, emotional 
  blackmail or force to compel someone to have sex with us, then this is sexual 
  misconduct. Adultery is also a form of sexual misconduct because when we marry 
  we promise our spouse we will be loyal to them. When we commit adultery we break 
  that promise and betray their trust. Sex should be an expression of love an 
  intimacy between two people and when it is it contributes to our mental and 
  emotional well-being. <br>

  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q8"></a>8.QUESTION: </strong>Is sex before marriage a type 
  of sexual misconduct? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>Not if there is love and 
  mutual agreement between the two people. However it should never be forgotten 
  that the biological function of sex is to reproduce and if an unmarried woman 
  becomes pregnant it can cause a great deal of problems. Many mature and thoughtful 
  people think it is far better to leave sex until after marriage. <br>

  <strong><a name="Q9"></a>9.QUESTION: </strong>But what about lying? Is it possible 
  to live without telling lies? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>If it is really impossible 
  to get by in society or business without lying, such a shocking and corrupt 
  state of affairs should be changed. The Buddhist is someone who resolves to 
  do something practical about the problem by trying to be more truthful and honest.

  <strong><a name="Q10"></a>10.QUESTION: </strong>Well, what about alcohol? Surely 
  a little drink doesn&#8217;t hurt. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>People don&#8217;t drink 
  for the taste. When they drink alone it is in order to seek release from tension 
  and when they drink socially, it is usually to conform. Even a small amount 
  of alcohol distorts consciousness and disrupts self-awareness. Taken in large 
  quantities, its effect can be devastating. <br>

  ________________________________________<br>
  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q11"></a>11.QUESTION: </strong>But drinking just a small amount 
  wouldn&#8217;t be really breaking the precept, would it? It&#8217;s only a small 
  thing. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> Yes, it is only a small 
  thing and if you can&#8217;t practise even a small thing, your commitment and 
  resolution isn&#8217;t very strong, is it? <br>
  <br>
  <a href="#Q11">back to top</a> <br>

  <br>
  <strong><a name="Q12"></a>12.QUESTION: </strong>The five precepts are negative. 
  They tell you what not to do. They don&#8217;t tell you what to do. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> The Five Precepts are the 
  basis of Buddhist morality. They are not all of it. We start by recognising 
  our bad behaviour and striving to stop doing it. That is what the Five Precepts 
  are for. After we have stopped doing bad, we then commence to do good. Take 
  for example, speech. The Buddha says we should start by refraining from telling 
  lies. After that, we should speak the truth, speak gently and politely and speak 
  at the right time. He says: <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of truth, reliable, trustworthy, 
  dependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up malicious speech he does 
  not repeat there what he has heard here no does he repeat here what he has heard 
  there in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those who are 
  divided and brings closer together those who are already friends. Harmony is 
  his joy, harmony is his delight, harmony is his love; it is the motive of his 
  speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is blameless, pleasing to the ear, 
  agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most. Giving up idle chatter 
  he speaks at the right time, what is correct, to the point, about Dhamma and 
  about discipline. He speaks words worth being treasured up, seasonable, reasonable, 
  well defined and to the point.&quot; </font></p>
