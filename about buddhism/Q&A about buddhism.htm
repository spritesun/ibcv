        In Buddhism, fruit is among the ten most commonly offered items. The ten 
        offerings are, incense, flowers, lights, fruit, fragrance, tea, food, 
        treasures, pearls, and clothing. Like all offerings, a gift of fruit is 
        used to show our appreciation and respect to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. 
        There are no restrictions about any specific kind of fruit as long as 
        we carefully wash the fruit and offer it sincerity. How can a Buddha or 
        Bodhisattva, who has attained enlightenment, ever differentiate the kind

        Buddhist festivals are celebrated? When and how?</font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13">There are a number of Buddhist festivals 
        celebrated throughout the year, of which the most important is the commemoration 
        of Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. There are three days to 
        be honored and the dates are based on the Chinese Lunar calendar: Sakyamuni 
        Buddha's Birthday -- 8 April Sakyamuni Buddha's Renouncement Day -- 8 
        February Sakyamuni Buddha's Enlightenment Day -- 8 December Sakyamuni 
        Buddha's Birthday is also called the Bathing Buddha Festival. According 
        to the legend, after the baby prince was born, he walked seven steps forward 
        and at each step, a lotus flower sprang up from the ground. Two dragons 
        appeared in the sky, gently spurting two streams of purified water down, 
        one warm and one cool, to bathe the baby. Thereafter, when people celebrate 
        the Buddha's birthday, they use fragrant water to bathe the Buddha statue. 
        This ritual symbolizes the purification of our mind, signifying that it 
        is easy to wash away our physical dirt, but is difficult to remove inner 
        or mental dirt of greed, anger, and ignorance. Sakyamuni Buddha's Enlightenment 
        Day is commemorated in a Dharma function and is usually celebrated by 
        eating the &quot;December 8th congee,&quot; which is prepared with eight 
        vegetarian ingredients. Before his enlightenment, he practiced a wide 
        variety of asceticism, and reduced his diet until he was eating nothing 
        at all, but still he could not succeed. He realized that neither self-mortification 
        nor self-indulgence was the way; the only way to enlightenment should 
        be the &quot;Middle path&quot; between the two extremes. He finally accepted 
        the milk offered to him by a shepherdess to regain his energy. At the 
        age of 35, while sitting under a bodhi tree in deep contemplation, he 
        became enlightened. In celebrating this day, the eating of the congee 
        is to symbolize the nourishing of the physical body which is important 
        for our cultivation and enlightenment.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"><font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="3"></a>How 
        do I create good affinity?</font><br>
        <strong>There are four ways: </strong><br>
        (1) Through Time: Building good affinity in the present is the foundation 
        for future affinity. What we do and how we relate to others in the present 
        moment nurtures positive conditions and connections for the future. Even 
        a small but friendly gesture toward a stranger today will eventually result 
        in positive affinity. When we create positive karma throughout time, both 
        in the present and for the future, its perpetual generation will eventually 
        yield beneficial results. <br>
        <br>
        (2) Through Space: We not only need to generate good affinity for our 
        immediate surroundings, we must also do so for the universal environment. 
        In fact, the karma we create for our present location contains the cause 
        for karma of distant locations, and ultimately, all locations. In Buddhist 
        beliefs, space and time exist on a continuum. Therefore, we must not neglect 
        even the smallest good deed within our limited environment. We are planting 
        a seed that will eventually grow into a gigantic tree. <br>
        <br>
        (3) Through Human World: In addition to developing good relationships 
        with our fellow human beings, we should build affinity with all beings. 
        We will generate everlasting affinity that is in harmony with the Dharma. 
        <br>
        <br>
        (4) Through Cause and Effect: There are three types of human connections: 
        &quot;intimate relations,&quot; &quot;changing relations,&quot; and &quot;passing 
        relations.&quot; Intimate relations strengthen the connections in relationships 
        that are already close. Changing relations improve the compatibility within 
        difficult relationships. For example, this may occurs in a family setting, 
        between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. We can create positive affinity 
        to resolve misunderstanding and bring peace and harmony into the family. 
        Passing relations cultivate the interconnectedness that exists between 
        all beings, include strangers. For instance, when you help someone who 
        has fallen down, the two of you had no relationship before, but now, a 
        connection has been formed.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"><font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="4"></a>How 
        many types of meditation are there?</font><br>
        Meditation is simply concentrated awareness; so in practicing, there are 
        two types of meditation that help to develop your concentration -- Samatha 
        Meditation and Vipassana Meditation. If the Samatha (Concentration) Meditation 
        is adopted, then the emphasis is on learning to apply concentration or 
        a one-pointed mind in your daily life. If Vipassana (Insight) Meditation 
        is chosen, then learning to apply awareness and mindfulness to your daily 
        life is the focus. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"><font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="5"></a>If 
        our lives are determined by our karma, can we change it? </font><br>
        Yes, we can change our karma. Karma results from the seeds of good and 
        evil deeds stored in the alaya-vijnana and will manifest when the right 
        conditions arise. Some seeds ripen in this life, some in the next life, 
        and some in future lives. Evil seeds that have already been planted will 
        inevitably give rise to evil fruit. They will not be cancelled out by 
        doing good deeds. The only thing we can do to change our destiny or to 
        prevent the reaping of evil fruit is to practice kind deeds, correct our 
        faults, and create more good conditions. In doing so, the seeds of evil 
        deeds will not have the proper conditions to grow and the evil fruit will 
        be less severe. If many good deeds are performed, good fruit will ripen 
        quickly, so that evil conditions will be weakened. This is like a glass 
        of salt water, which is similar to evil deeds. If a lot of fresh water, 
        which symbolizes good deeds, is added to the salt water, the fresh water 
        will dilute the salt water, making it less salty. Thus by doing good deeds 
        and creating good conditions, one's life can be changed for the better.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> <font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="6"></a>What 
        message does Buddhism offer the world today? </font><br>
        In the world today, environmental pollution has become a serious problem 
        and finally, humankind has begun to understand the need for protecting 
        our environment. However, the problem of mental or spiritual pollution 
        is many times more serious than that of the physical environment. Not 
        many people realize that mental and spiritual neglect and disarray is 
        the source of worldly ills. Buddhism, the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha, 
        is considered the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous society because 
        it can purify the human mind to establish a pureland on earth. Buddhism 
        provides the solution to a myriad of social ills and leads the way to 
        changing one's suffering into happiness. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"> <font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="7"></a>What 
        kind of spiritual fulfillment do Buddhists seek? </font><br>
        The spiritual fulfillment a Buddhist seeks is the recovery of the true 
        basic nature or Buddha nature from the inner mind, in which the ultimate 
        wisdom can be attained. The Buddha taught us that the main objective of 
        our practice or cultivation was to achieve this ultimate wisdom. Everyone 
        has the potential to realize this state of ultimate wisdom, as it is an 
        intrinsic part of our nature, not something one obtains externally. Thus, 
        Buddhism aims at regaining our own intrinsic nature which is now temporarily 
        lost as a result of our delusion and confusion. Due to our lack of wisdom, 
        we perceive, view, and behave foolishly, and thus suffer the consequences 
        evoked by our incorrect actions. With wisdom, we can solve our problems 
        and turn suffering into happiness. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="435f13"><font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="8"></a>What 
        is the righteous attitude in Taking Refuge? </font><br>
        Taking refuge is the initiation that one undergoes to formally become 
        a Buddhist. It is a person's lifelong decision to devote themselves to 
        the Buddhist path. Students must follow the proper steps in a timely manner, 
        completing their registration forms before taking the classes. When one 
        Takes Refuge, he is taking refuge in all Buddhas, the Dharma, and the 
        Sangha from the Ten directions. The most significant aspect of the decision 
        is vowing to take refuge in the Triple Gem within oneself, rather than 
        in a specific person or a venerable. After one takes refuge and formally 
        becomes a Buddhist, he or she is a disciple of Buddhism rather that of 
        a specific person<br>
        <br>
        <font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="9"></a>Why should we be vegetarians, 
        as long as we have a good heart and do not engage in harmful behavior? 
        </font><br>
        Such a question may seem quite reasonable. However, if you consider it 
        further, a significant discrepancy arises. As a merciful and good-hearted 
        person, how can you bear to take pleasure in a meal for which another 
        sentient being has suffered? How can you consider yourself merciful and 
        compassionate if you ignore the pains of the animals that are sacrificed 
        for your enjoyment? The primary reason why Buddhism encourages people 
        to be vegetarians is to help nurture their compassion. Confucianism expresses 
        a maxim regarding meat eating: &quot;When you see a living thing you cannot 
        bear to see it die. After you hear it cry when being slaughtered you can 
        not bear to eat its flesh. Thus, as a kind person, you should stay away 
        from the kitchen.&quot; From this, we can see that vegetarianism carries 
        great significance in the nurturing of mercy and compassion.</font></p>

        Try the following: (1) Face it squarely and challenge it. (2) Learn to 
        deal with it. Everything in this world can be resolved. (3) Stay steady. 
        Have confidence! Don't be swayed by changes. (4) Think about what the 
        wise teachers of past and present would do. Follow their examples and 
        go forward. (5) Read stories of Buddhist masters of the past. Learn from 
        their examples of courage under difficult challenges. (6) Consider whether 
        you have any choices in the matter? When there is no other choice, you 
        have to carry on. (7) Find strength in defeat. Don't give up. Remember 
        what Buddha did when he had to face the demons. (8) Be flexible. Think 
        of an alternative way to reach your goal. (9) Tell yourself, &quot;Only 
        through challenge, can I gain confidence to successful meet challenge.&quot; 
        (10) Remain strong. Value your life. (11) Remind yourself, &quot;Troubles 
        will not stay forever. Seeking enlightenment, on the other hand, is a 
        long-term task. Don't be afraid.&quot; (12) Fight trouble using your wisdom, 
        not your anger. All situations are a test of one's life. (13) Repeat this, 
        &quot;May all beings be free from suffering. Do not ask happiness for 
        oneself alone. (14) Recite the passage, &quot;Before Heaven entrusts a 
        great task to a person, it will first examine the person's spirit and

        an ornately designed temple considered lavish? </font><br>
        When people visit a temple and see the fine decoration of the guestroom 
        and conference room, they sometimes resent and criticize the facilities, 
        insisting that a Dharma site should not be so luxurious. Does their reaction 
        imply that a Buddhist temple should always appear dilapidated? In the 
        Amitabha sutra, for example, we learn about the Amitabha Pure Land where 
        the Dharma pervades the scenery, making the land a visual paradise. In 
        this humanistic realm, we also need a good facility to teach the Dharma, 
        a tattered guestroom or conference room offers no incentive for people 
        to visit or hold meetings. Such a result not only hinders the progress 
        and development of Buddhism, but also provides less opportunity to attract 
        people. It is important for a temple to be respectfully and attentively 
        decorated, in order to create an atmosphere of beauty and serenity.</font></p>

        do we practice the merit of rejoicing in the welfare of others? </font><br>
        Among the Samantabadra Bodhisattava's ten great vows, there is one good 
        deed called rejoicing with others' inclination. Buddhism emphasizes more 
        on the merit of rejoicing in the welfare of others than monetary contributions. 
        For, the former attributes even more merits than the monetary contribution 
        and the merit generated through such practice is immeasurably infinite. 
        So, how do we practice this cultivation? Simply by giving happiness to 
        others anytime or anyplace. From the moment you wake up in the morning, 
        greet people by saying, how are you or good morning; give a friendly smile 
        to people you see. These kind of gestures are considered rejoicing in 
        the welfare of others. Still, there are other ways such as paying respect 
        through eye contact. Carry out the virtuous life of rejoicing in the welfare 
        of others in our daily life anytime anywhere. For example, nod and waive 
        to others; give a handy service to others; give an appropriate praising 
        to others; offer earnest caring to others. Moreover, sharing your gourmet 
        food with your friends will make the food more enjoyable. Sharing a good 
        saying with your friends will broaden your vision of life. Sharing the 
        exquisite of the Dharma to your friends or even all the sentient beings, 
        will beautify your life and make it meaningful. Now, do not forget to 
        always wear a smile my friend; give a friendly greeting, and blend the 
        merit of rejoicing for others in your life.</font></p>

        attitude towards drugs and alcohol in Buddhism? </font><br>
        When drugs are abused, the results can be devastating; for the abuser, 
        for those who care for him or her, and for society at large. Alcoholism 
        is a chronic illness which manifests itself as a disorder of behavior. 
        In Buddhism, the last of the Five Precepts advocates total abstinence 
        from the consumption of intoxicants including drugs and alcohol. The observance 
        by Buddhists of this precept is extremely important for the well being 
        of one's mental and physical health. However, flexibility is allowed in 
        situations such as when alcohol or drugs have to be used for medical purposes, 
        or if one uses strict self-control in consuming a minimal amount in a 
        situation that cannot be avoided.</font></p>

        attitude towards stealing in Buddhism? </font><br>
        Stealing is considered as an invasion of other people's property. No stealing 
        is also one of the Five Precepts for Buddhists. Stealing is taking away 
        other's possessions without the consent of the owner. </font></p>

        attitude towards lying in Buddhism? Is it possible to live a life without 
        telling lies?</font><br>
        Lying is forbidden in Buddhism and is again advocated by one of the Five 
        Precepts. Though it is difficult to live a life without telling lies, 
        we should still try our best to abide by this principle. There may be 
        situations when lies are unavoidable; if the lies are for the benefit 
        of others, they are not considered a violation of the precept.</font></p>

        do you think about the hermetic life?</font><br>
        A Buddhist saying tells us, &quot;Do not live alone in the mountains until 
        you have become enlightened. Do not live in solitude until you have realized 
        the true nature of all things.&quot; Locking ourselves away in isolation 
        is not truly practicing Humanistic Buddhism. If we do not establish wisdom 
        and merit well enough, our affliction do not cut off even we are in solitary 
        practice. When we emerge from isolation, the world is still there, with 
        all of its challenges. Closing ourselves off from these challenges, avoiding 
        facing the world, and living off other's donations and generosities make 
        us parasites on society. This is not practicing Buddhism, but an excuse 
        for being lazy, and should not be encouraged.<br>

        <font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="18"></a>What does &quot;Using Falsehood 
        to Cultivate Truth&quot; mean?</font><br>
        &quot;Falsehood&quot; is our body. &quot;Truth&quot; is our mind. To practice 
        Buddhism is to cultivate our mind. Our body is but a tool for this purpose. 
        Most people pay so much attention to their bodies and ignore their minds. 
        This is backwards. A hundred years from now, we will no longer have this 
        body; nor the same friends, relatives, or wealth. But we will still have 
        our mind. As Buddhist saying goes, &quot;You take only karma with you 
        at the time you die&quot;. Only our karma and our mind belong to us. In 
        a story in the sutra, The Mind said to The Body, &quot;Everyday, from 
        morning to night, I help you get dressed, get washed, get fed, get going, 
        and etc. Now you want to practice Buddhism, you run around to all the 
        temples, dragging an empty shell this way and that. This is like looking 
        for fish in the woods. Why don't you ask me about the Way? Listen to this: 
        &quot;The Buddha dwells at the Spiritual Peak, Seek Him not afar. Within 
        your heart is the Spiritual Peak, With an altar already there. Better 
        practice at your own altar by the Peak. It is silly of you to neglect 
        me, The Mind, instead to look for The Buddha everywhere else.&quot; The 
        important thing in this life is to find our true nature. </font></p>

        are the Four Noble Truths? </font><br>
        To cleanse ignorance which is the source of all suffering, one must understand 
        the Four Noble Truths: 1. The Truth of Suffering -- Life is subject to 
        all kinds of suffering, the most basic being birth, aging, disease, and 
        death. No one is exempt from these stages of existence. 2. The Cause of 
        Suffering -- Suffering is caused by ignorance that results in desire and 
        craving. It is craving which produces rebirth, accompanied by passionate 
        clinging in life. It is the craving for pleasure, fame, or materialistic 
        possessions that causes great dissatisfaction with life. 3. The Cessation 
        of Suffering -- Cessation of suffering comes from total elimination of 
        ignorance and detachment from desires and craving, reaching a state of 
        supreme bliss or nirvana, wherein all suffering is extinguished. 4. The 
        Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering -- The way leading to the cessation 
        of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path. <br>

        Amitabha Buddha is not Sakyamuni Buddha. Amitabha Buddha is the Buddha 
        of the Western Pureland, which is not to be understood as a specific location 
        but as a state of consciousness. Amitabha is Sanskrit meaning infinite 
        light and life. </font></p>

        The Noble Eightfold Path consists of: 1. Right understanding -- Have the 
        knowledge of the Four Noble Truths so that one can understand things as 
        they really are. 2. Right thought -- Develop a noble character of life 
        and do not cause harm to others. 3. Right speech -- Abstain from lying, 
        idle-talk, slander, and harsh words. 4. Right action -- Abstain from killing, 
        stealing and sexual misconduct. 5. Right livelihood -- Avoid any occupation 
        that causes harm to others such as butchering or selling intoxicants like 
        alcohol or drugs. 6. Right effort -- Have self-discipline to attain full 
        control of the mind in order to develop a clear mental state, thus avoiding 
        an evil mental state. 7. Right mindfulness -- Develop awareness of all 
        actions of the body, speech and mind so as to avoid wrongdoing. 8. Right

        <font color="ac5358" size="4"><a name="22"></a>Why does Buddhism describe 
        the deceased ones as &quot;leaving for rebirth&quot;?</font><br>
        From the objective meaning of Buddhism, all deceased who go to the three 
        realms, six realms or even the Pure Land are all considered &quot;left 
        for rebirth&quot;. It wasn't until the Pure Land theory became more popular 
        that a subjective category was set to include only those who are reborn 
        in the Saha world (the human world) or the Pure Land as &quot;leaving 
        for rebirth.&quot; &quot;Leaving for&quot; stands for going to the Pure 
        Land while &quot;rebirth&quot; designates a transformation within the 
        seven precious lotus flowers in the Pure Land. The significance of calling 
        the deceased &quot;leaving for rebirth&quot; implies good wishes for the 
        deceased, the rebirth in the good realm.</font></p>

        It takes a healthy body for one to preach the Dharma and benefit all sentient 
        beings. Normally Ch'an practitioners abide by &quot;the diet rule&quot; 
        which prohibits eating after lunch. Thus, Ch'an School considers porridge 
        served at dinnertime as medicine and simply calls it &quot;medicine meal&quot;. 
        Meaning, eating at dinnertime is merely for the purpose of curing our 
        hunger. The purpose of doing so is to restrain us from leading an excessive 
        eating or wasting habit. We can also be refrained from the desire of greed 
        by cutting down the habit of lavishness and wasting. (Beginning tomorrow, 
        we will publish a series on &quot;Daily Buddhist Wisdom---Dhammapada&quot;)

        Rare moment of symmetry: palindrome minute for a palindrome day in a palindrome 
        year <br>
        Wow! For one minute, the world will be in perfect symmetry.<br>
        In a year that reads the same backward as forward, Wednesday evening will 
        bring 60 seconds of palindromic perfection - at least for those who follow 
        the Gregorian calendar.<br>
        Today, the time, day, month and year will align: 8:02 p.m., Feb. 20, 2002.<br>
        Write that in military time and with numerals for the month of February 
        and it works out to: 20:02, 02/20, 2002. In European style for the day 
        and month it's just as balanced: 20:02, 20/02, 2002.<br>
        &#8220;A mirror day like this is a good opportunity for reflecting,&#8221; 
        said Mark Saltveit, editor of The Palindromist magazine. He is devoted 
        to palindromes of all sorts - strings of numbers, words or sentences that 
        read the same backward or forward. The rare moment is drawing its share 
        of attention: Saltveit, a standup comedian, said he already has three 
        radio interviews lined up with European stations.<br>
        Separately, a Web site is calling for a two-minute prayer for peace to 
        begin at the start of the palindromic moment. And an e-mail is making 
        the rounds touting the rare alignment - though it mistakenly says the 
        event last happened on Jan. 10, 1001 and will never happen again.<br>
        (Actually, it happened in the year 1111 and will again in 2112). Of course, 
        all the excitement comes from a Western perspective, leaving aside the 
        many other calendars that track the passage of time - Chinese, Islamic, 
        Jewish, Ethiopian and others</font></p>
