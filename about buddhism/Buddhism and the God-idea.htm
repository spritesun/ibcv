<p align="justify"><font color="435f13"><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do Buddhists 
  believe in a god? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#FF3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>No, we do not. There are 
  several reasons for this. The Buddha, like modern sociologists and psychologists, 
  believed that religious ideas and especially the god idea have their origins 
  in fear. The Buddha says: <br>
  <br>
  Gripped by fear men go to sacred mountains, sacred groves, sacred trees and 
  shrines. <br>
  <br>
  Primitive man found himself in a dangerous and hostile world, the fear of wild 
  animals, of not being able to find enough food, of injury or disease, and of 
  natural phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly with 
  him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to give him comfort 
  in good times, courage in times of danger and consolation when things went wrong. 
  To this day, you will notice that people become more religious at times of crises, 
  you will hear them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength 
  they need to deal with life. You will hear them explain that they believe in 
  a particular god because they prayed in time of need and their prayer was answered. 
  All this seems to support the Buddha&#8217;s teaching that the god-idea is a 
  response to fear and frustration. The Buddha taught us to try to understand 
  our fears, to lessen our desires and to calmly and courageously accept the things 
  we cannot change. He replaced fear, not with irrational belief but with rational 
  understanding. <br>
  <br>
  The second reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is because there does 
  not seem to be any evidence to support this idea. There are numerous religions, 
  all claiming that they alone have god&#8217;s words preserved in their holy 
  book, that they alone understand god&#8217;s nature, that their god exists and 
  that the gods of other religions do not. Some claim that god is masculine, some 
  that she is feminine and others that it is neuter. They are all satisfied that 
  there is ample evidence to prove the existence of their god but they laugh in 
  disbelief at the evidence other religions use to prove the existence of another 
  god. It is not surprising that with so many different religions spending so 
  many centuries trying to prove the existence of their gods that still no real, 
  concrete, substantial or irrefutable evidence has been found. Buddhists suspend 
  judgement until such evidence is forthcoming. <br>
  <br>
  The third reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is that the belief is not 
  necessary. Some claim that the belief in a god is necessary in order to explain 
  the origin of the universe. But this is not so. Science has very convincingly 
  explained how the universe came into being without having to introduce the god-idea. 
  Some claim that belief in god is necessary to have a happy, meaningful life. 
  Again we can see that this is not so. There are millions of atheists and free-thinkers, 
  not to mention many Buddhists, who live useful, happy and meaningful lives without 
  belief in a god. Some claim that belief in god&#8217;s power is necessary because 
  humans, being weak, do not have the strength to help themselves. Once again, 
  the evidence indicates the opposite. One often hears of people who have overcome 
  great disabilities and handicaps, enormous odds and difficulties through their 
  own inner resources, through their own efforts and without belief in a god. 
  Some claim that god is necessary in order to give man salvation. But this argument 
  only holds good if you accept the theological concept of salvation and Buddhists 
  do not accept such a concept. Based on his own experience, the Buddha saw that 
  each human being had the capacity to purify the mind, develop infinite love 
  and compassion and perfect understanding. He shifted attention from the heavens 
  to the heart and encouraged us to find solutions to our problems through self-understanding.

  <strong>QUESTION: </strong>But if there are no gods how did the universe get 
  here? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> All religions have myths 
  and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when man 
  simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the 
  age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific 
  fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the 
  god-idea. <br>
  ________________________________________<br>
  <br>
  <strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does the Buddha say about the origin of the 
  universe? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> It is interesting that 
  the Buddha&#8217;s explanation of the origin of the universe corresponds very 
  closely to the scientific view. In the Aganna Sutta, The Buddha describes the 
  universe being destroyed and then re-evolving into its present form over a period 
  of countless millions of years. The first life formed on the surface of the 
  water and again, over countless millions of years, evolved from simple into 
  complex organisms. All these processes are without beginning or end, and are 
  set in motion by natural causes. <br>

  <br>
  <strong>QUESTION:</strong> You say there is no evidence for the existence of 
  a god. But what about miracles? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>There are many who believe 
  that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild claims that a healing 
  has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office 
  or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved 
  from disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is supposed to 
  have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened 
  a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. 
  Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid evidence 
  and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However, sometimes unexplained 
  things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such 
  things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge 
  is as yet incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people 
  didn&#8217;t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods 
  sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when 
  we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more 
  complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just 
  as we can now understand what causes disease. <br>

  <br>
  <strong>QUESTION:</strong> But so many people believe in some form of god, it 
  must be true. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER:</font></strong> Not so. There was a time 
  when everyone believed that the world was flat, but they were all wrong. The 
  number of people who believe in an idea is no measure of the truth or falsehood 
  of that idea. The only way we can tell whether an idea is true or not is by 
  looking at the facts and examining the evidence. <br>

  <br>
  <strong>QUESTION: </strong>So if Buddhists don&#8217;t believe in gods, what 
  do you believe in? <br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="ff3300">ANSWER: </font></strong>We don&#8217;t believe 
  in a god because we believe in man. We believe that each human being is precious 
  and important, that all have the potential to develop into a Buddha &#8211; 
  a perfected human being. We believe that human beings can outgrow ignorance 
  and irrationality and see things as they really are. We believe that hatred, 
  anger, spite and jealousy can be replaced by love, patience, generosity and 
  kindness. We believe that all this is within the grasp of each person if they 
  make the effort, guided and supported by fellow Buddhists and inspired by the 
  example of the Buddha. As the Buddha says: <br>
  No one saves us but ourselves, <br>
  No one can and no one may. <br>
  We ourselves must walk the path, <br>
  But Buddhas clearly show the way.</font></p>
