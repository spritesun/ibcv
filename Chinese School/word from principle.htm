    <td><p><font size="5">S</font>ince its establishment in 1995, Fo Guang Chinese 
        School has entered into its tenth years. In these tem years, Fo Guang 
        Chinese School has worked relentlessly in following the educational ideals 
        of the founder of fo guang shan, Venerable Master Hsing Yun; in promoting 
        the Chinese culture, and nurturing student's oral, written, comprehension 
        and expressive skills. In addition, it has educated students in moral 
        and ethical principles, and instilled in them right thoughts and right 
        views on life and on the principle of cause and effect. The duty of educating 
        is to nurture well-rounded personalities, allowing students to enjoy well-balanced 
        development in the areas of knowledge growth and virtuous character building.</p>
      <p>Therefore, besides conducting formal courses, the school also holds various 
        competitive event, such as Mother's Day writing competitions drawing competitions, 
        handwriting competitions. These activities have all been designed to develop 
        the student's interest in learning in learning and to encourage the building 
        of good relationships with other students. For the enjoyment of the general 
        public, the school is also involved in organising lantern decorating competitions 
        during Buddha's Day Multicultural Festival, to provide the opportunity 
        for student interaction between it's own students and that of other schools. 
        At the same time, students of the school also rank highly amongst their 
        VCE peers, achieving outstanding results in the VCE Chinese Language examinations. 
        the students are appreciative and well aware of the diligent efforts of 
        their teachers, and the benefits of practice and repetition, which allow 
        them to excel in the oral examinations. The efforts of both the school 
        and its teachers in educating nurturing the students have culminated in 
        these results.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Fo Guang happy Camp is held annually, with its main 
        aim being to provide an enjoyable holiday period by delivering education 
        through play modes. Through such an event, the student's abilities to 
        both be a team player and be independent are nurtured and daily living 
        matters, art and crafts skills, and team building. In such a manner, the 
        students and teachers can work together and establish an interactive learning 
        environment. The event concludes amongst laughter and they excitedly await 
        next year's camp to arrive.</p>
      <p>Fo Guang Chinese School not only expects their teachers to impart up-to-date 
        knowledge to their students and explicate any misguided concepts, they 
        are also required to practice compassion and loving-kindness as demonstrated 
        by the Avalokitesvara (Kuan Yin) Bodhiativas towards their students. As 
        an aside, the school invests in the education and training of its teachers 
        to enhance their professional development. For example, through participation 
        in the teaching programs for language schools run by the Department of 
        Education, and training courses for overseas teachers run by the Overseas 
        Chinese Affairs Commission. R.O.C. allows for the improvement of the caliber 
        of the teachers.</p>
      <p>In order for the teaching and education provided to be even more beneficial, 
        we hope the school magazine is a means of communication and information 
        sharing, hence enhancing the working relationship between students, teachers, 
        their parents and the school, and striving to bring forth an even more 
        excellent learning environment; so as to provide an exceptional level 
        of education and thus be the desired language school of choice.</p>
