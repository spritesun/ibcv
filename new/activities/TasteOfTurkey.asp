		<p>Across all corners of the globe, Turkey's rich history of arts and crafts is alive and well, living and breathing in the hearts of the

		over many centuries.The country's extraordinary range of arts and crafts has
        evolved to become a unique reflection and celebration of its people's enduring values and experiences.</p>
        <p>Over the last 60 years the Turkish community of Victoria has continued these rich, artistic and cultural practices 
        by producing an incredible range of traditional and contemporary arts. This exhibition, coordinated by the Moreland Turkish Education 
        and Social Affairs Centre, offers a wonderful collection of work including marbling, crochet, carpet weaving, jewellery-making,painting
        and photography, featuring artists such as Aysegul Pesmen, Muzaffer Orucoglu, Umit Ugur,and organizations such as Vizyonart and the Australian 
        Western Thrace Turkish Association.</p>
