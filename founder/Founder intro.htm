        Master Hsing Yun was born in Chiangtu, Chiangsu province, China, in 1927. 
        Tonsured under Ven. Master Chih Kai at age twelve, he became a novice 
        monk at Chi-hsia Shan, a mountain monastery in Nanjing, China.</font></p>
      <p><font color="435f13">After arriving in Taiwan in the spring of 1949, 
        the Ven. Master became the chief editor of Life Journal, Awakening The 
        World, Buddhism Today, and a host of other publications. In 1952, while 
        staying at Lei-yin Temple of Ilan, he initiated chanting groups, student 
        and youth organizations, children's Sunday school, and various Dharma 
        teams that eventually laid the foundation for his future efforts in Buddhist

      <p><font color="435f13">In 1957, the Ven. Master established a Buddhist 
        cultural center that became today's Foguang Cultural Enterprise Co., Ltd. 
        in which a variety of Buddhist books are being published with training 
        tools such as audio and visual aids. Subsequently, the founding of Fo 
        Guang Shan Buddhist Order in 1967 actualizes the Ven. Master's vision 
        of Humanistic Buddhism via education, cultural activities, charity, and 
        religious practices that &quot;foster talent, propagate the Dharma, provide 
        relief aid, and cultivate morality in people.&quot; Since then, over one 
        hundred and fifty branch temples have been established worldwide. Among 
        them are Hsi Lai Temple, Nan Tien Temple, and Nan Hua Temple, the biggest 
        temples ever built in North America, Australia, and Africa, respectively. 
        In addition to art museums, libraries, publishing houses, and bookstores, 
        the Ven. Master also established a free medical clinic, a Buddhist research 
        institute, two high schools (Chih-kuang and Pu-men High Schools), the 
        Hsi Lai University in the United States, as well as Fo Guang University 
        and Nan Hua University in Taiwan. In 1970, 1975, and 1987 respectively, 
        the &quot;Ta Tzu Children's Home,&quot; &quot;Fo Guang Light Lodge,&quot; 
        and &quot;Compassion Foundation&quot; were formed to provide for orphans, 
        abandoned children, senior citizens, as well as the poor and needy in 
        Taiwan. Fo Guang Tripitaka Editing Committee was also formed in 1977, 
        and has continued to work diligently toward the publication and advancement 
        of the &quot;Fo Guang Buddhist Canon&quot; and &quot;Fo Guang Encyclopedia.&quot; 
        In 1997, &quot;Excerpts of Chinese Buddhism Tripitaka in Modern Texts&quot; 
        was successfully completed with the &quot;Fo Guang Encyclopedia&quot; 
        on CD, followed by the formation of Buddha's Light TV Station and Buddha's 
        Light Internet Network as BLIA advanced in line with modern technology. 
        Books authored by the Ven. Master that are widely distributed include 
        The Life of Sakyamuni Buddha, The Buddha's Ten Great Disciples, Hsing 
        Yun's Ch'an Talk, The Buddhism Volumes, Ven. Master Hsing Yun's Lectures 
        Series, The Buddhism Textbooks, Beads of Pearl - Prayers for Engaged Living,

        have been tonsured under Ven. Master Hsing Yun who has over a million 
        followers worldwide. Throughout his life, the Ven. Master has dedicated 
        himself to propagating the ideals of &quot;Humanistic Buddhism&quot; and 
        being &quot;a global person&quot; in which the spirits of joy and harmony, 
        integration and coexistence, respect and magnanimity, equality and peace 
        are widely disseminated. Upon the inception of Buddha's Light International 
        Association on February 3, 1991, Ven. Master Hsing Yun was elected to 
        assume its presidency. As of 1997, over one hundred international chapters 
        of BLIA have been established to carry out the Ven. Master's ideal of 
        &quot;letting the Buddha's Light shine over the three thousand realms 
        and the Dharma's current flow throughout the five continents.&quot;</font></p></td>

        has been recognized with numerous awards. In addition to the highly acclaimed 
        honors received in his home country, the Republic of China, the Ven. Master 
        has also gained international prestige for his selfless dedication and 
        contributions. For example, he is the first person from the ROC to be 
        granted an honorary Ph.D. by the University of Oriental Studies in 1978, 
        and was awarded the &quot;Buddhist Gem Award&quot; by the Indian National 
        Buddhist Assembly in 1995. In May of 1997, the Ministry for Internal and 
        Foreign Affairs honored him &quot;the top award&quot; in recognition of 
        his extraordinary contribution to society, his country, and Buddhism at 
        large. In February of 1998, the Ven. Master hosted the Triple Platform 
        Full Ordination Ceremony along with the Five and Bodhisattva Precepts 
        Ceremonies in Bodhgaya, India so as to restore the Theravada bhiksunis 
        precepts, which had been lost for over a millenium. On April 8, 1998, 
        he was bestowed the Buddha's tooth relic which he personally escorted 
        from India to Taiwan where it would remain. The Ven. Master's contribution 
        toward Buddhism is truly phenomenal, and has helped Buddhism gain a better 
        understanding from society amidst current trends of institutionalization, 
        modernization, humanism, and globalization. <a href="founder_%20pic/master_sliceshow/New%20Folder/index.htm"><font size="4">and
